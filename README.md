# Silent Crash on Unhandled Async Errors in Express.js

This repository demonstrates a common but subtle error in Express.js applications: silent crashes due to unhandled errors within asynchronous operations.  When an asynchronous function (like a database query or an external API call) rejects, the Express.js server can crash without any clear indication of the problem if not handled correctly.

## The Problem

The `bug.js` file shows an example of an Express.js route handler that uses an asynchronous operation without proper error handling. If the asynchronous operation fails, the server silently crashes without providing any informative error message to the user or helpful logs to the developer.

## The Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates the correct way to handle asynchronous errors in Express.js.  By using a `.catch()` block or a `try...catch` statement, errors are caught, logged, and an appropriate error response is returned to the client. This prevents the server from crashing and provides helpful information for debugging.
